# Ethel Cain Song Tracker Site Proposal

## Team
- Sam Sutton
- Peter Hermanson

## Goal
The site will display Ethel Cain's discography in an organized manner. It will track information such as track title, artist, album, date, and length. Ideally you will also be able to sort the songs too, and *maybe* have images.

## Plan
We will create a database to store information about each song. We will get the information from Sam's spreadsheet, and the amount of tracks taken from the spreadsheet will depend on time constraints.

## Possible Pages
* Home page that displays all the songs in the database
  * Can sort by categories (such as track title, album, artist, date, length, type/tag, etc.)
  * Can search through them and show/hide certain information
  * Potentially have demos, remixes, and other alt versions of songs grouped together and be shown/hidden with a dropdown or something
* Album page
  * View all albums, EPs, compilation albums, and formally released singles, along with their tracklist and relevant information
* Artist page
  * View all named side projects, the tracks known to be attributed to each, and relevant information
* Possible page to add or delete tracks, or to edit info
